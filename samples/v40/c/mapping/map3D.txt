// This file contains information related to the configuration
// of stage error mapping applied to a 3D stage
// Axis Y is made of axes Y1 and Y2
// the file format is based on the one used in ComET identification files
//
// The stage error mapping data will be stored in AccurET controllers
// thus the different string values must not have a length bigger than 32 characters
// (8 depths of 4 bytes)

// this mapping mode is either error (substraction of the values) or correction (add of the values))
Correction mode,positive
// define of axes names, used below for the specifying which axis is concerned
